# Tumblr Feed
This is a simple read-only Tumblr client that demonstrates using table views, passing data between view controllers, and various navigation types in iOS.

This was done as an exercise for the [CodePath](http://codepath.com/) iOS for Engineers course.

## Features
* App is integrated with the **Tumblr API** to display photos
* User can **pull to refresh** main photo feed
* Feed demonstrates **infinite scrolling** with a **loading indicator**
* Each photo section has a **sticky header** that displays blog details
* Tapping a photo section transitions to photo details
* Tapping the photo in the details view presents a modal with a **zoomable, full-size photo**
